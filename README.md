# VPN Project
This project aims to build a VPN using Cloudflare's CDN services. The principle of this VPN is to constantly optimize the domain name. 

For accessing the pages and workers provided by Cloudflare, a CDN, please refer to the following steps:

1. Install the Clash tunnel program kernel for your computer. Visit [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/Clash.Meta) for more information and instructions.

2. For mobile phone users, download the Clashmeta mobile version from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/ClashMetaForAndroid). The usage of the mobile version is the same as the Clash tunnel tool.
